### Project Description
Love After Life is a delightfully horrific dating web app that connects zombies with their ideal undead match. Choose your preference, view spooky profiles, chat with your crush—all in one creepy, dark-mode interface.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
1.Zombies are lonely. Dating apps exclude the undead. Graveyards are full of singles, yet no one is matching them. That’s rotten behavior.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created Love After Life, a dating site made exclusively for zombies.

Pick your type: male, female, or “any decaying soul”

Swipe through eerie profiles featuring undead hobbies like “collecting skulls” and “late-night grave digging.”

Chat with your match using pre-programmed undead phrases

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)
screenshot1(index.html)
index.html (Home Page)

1. Page Setup: Uses meta viewport for responsiveness and imports Google Font (Chewy) for a quirky horror vibe.


2. Page Structure: Contains a background and overlay div, likely for styling effects, along with navigation.


3. Navigation Links: Placeholder # hrefs suggest these still need linking or updating for full functionality.


Screenshot2(gender.html)
gender.html

1. Navigation Bar: Links to index.html, gender.html (current), and chat.html with a "Find Now" button styled using a class.


2. Content Section: Includes an image (testtube.png) with alt text “Zombie Test Tubes” to illustrate the theme.


3. Git Terminal: Shows a successful git push origin main, confirming code is uploaded to GitHub.


Screenshot3(men.html)
men.html (Male Zombie Profiles)

Screenshot4(style.css)
style.css

1. Global Reset + Base Style: Removes default margin/padding, sets Comic Sans MS font, and hides overflow for clean layout.


2. Page Load Animation: Adds a fadeIn zoom effect on initial load using @keyframes and CSS animation.


3. Background Class: Prepares a fixed-position background (not shown in HTML yet) likely for aesthetic consistency.

1. Inline CSS Styling: Uses internal <style> to define .profile-card, including box shadow, border radius, and layout.


2. Profile Image Styling: Images are styled for consistent size (40% width) with rounded edges.


3. Minor Issue: Title incorrectly says "Women" instead of "Men"—should be updated for clarity.
